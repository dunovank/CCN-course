    "Your code will be evaluated on clarity, conciseness and efficiency. Document your code. The resulting notebook including the required outputs should be converted to pdf and uploaded to Blackboard. Comments can be added in the notebook using markdown cells. Note that for code development you may want to use the PyCharm IDE, which facilitates debugging."
